The commented text in your code describes the different states of an XMLHttpRequest object (XHR), which is fundamental to AJAX. Here's a clearer way to present this information:
XMLHttpRequest States:
1. State 0 (UNSENT): Initial state, object created but not initialized
2. State 1 (OPENED): Connection established via open()
3. State 2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED): Request sent and response headers received
4. State 3 (LOADING): Response data being received
5. State 4 (DONE): Request completed
This information is typically used when working with AJAX requests to track the progress and status of HTTP requests.
